// bugSolution.js
// This is a simplified example and the specific solution might vary depending on your project.
// The core idea is to ensure correct AGP version and handle dependency conflicts.

// Check if you are using a compatible version of expo and react-native.
// expo update  and yarn upgrade may help.

// Clean the project
// expo prebuild --clean

//Try upgrading Gradle
// If you are using expo 47 or above, you will want to make sure you have the latest version of Gradle.
// For expo 47, this should be Gradle 8.0 and you can set it in your android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties file
// distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.0-all.zip 

// Check your android/app/build.gradle file for any conflicting dependencies
// Also make sure that you are using the correct Android build tools version
// Use android studio to inspect the project and find the most compatible version for all.

//Try running expo prebuild after resolving conflicts
// expo prebuild 

// Try to build the project again
// expo build:android
