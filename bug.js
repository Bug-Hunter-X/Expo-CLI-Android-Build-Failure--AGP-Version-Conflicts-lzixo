This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves issues with the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version compatibility.  The error message isn't always consistent, but it often mentions version conflicts or failures during the build process.  For example, you might see an error like `Could not resolve all files for configuration ':app:debugImplementation'` with further details pointing to AGP version mismatches or missing dependencies.
